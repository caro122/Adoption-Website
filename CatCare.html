     <h1>How to care for a cat</h1>
     <h3>Grooming</h3>
     <p>Most cats stay relatively clean and rarely need a bath, but you should brush or comb your cat regularly. 
     Frequent brushing helps keep your cat's coat clean, reduces the amount of shedding and cuts down on the incidence of hairballs.</p>

     <h3>Handling</h3>
     <p>To pick up your cat, place one hand behind the front legs and another under the hindquarters. 
        Lift gently. Never pick up a cat by the scruff of the neck or by the front legs.

    <h3>Litter Box</h3>
    <p>All indoor cats need a litter box, which should be placed in a quiet, accessible location. 
        In a multi-level home, one box per floor is recommended. 
        Avoid moving the box unless absolutely necessary, but if you must do so, move the box just a few inches per day. 
        Keep in mind that cats won't use a messy, smelly litter box, so scoop solid wastes out of the box at least once a day. Dump everything, wash with a mild detergent and refill at least once a week; you can do this less frequently if using clumping litter. 
        Don't use ammonia, deodorants or scents, especially lemon, when cleaning the litter box.
        If your cat will not use a litterbox, please consult with your veterinarian. 
        Sometimes refusal to use a litter box is based on a medical condition that required treatment.</p>
